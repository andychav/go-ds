# Questions

I implemented the stack as a type that extends []interface{} but this did not encapsulate the array and was essentially an arr with stack functionality. Moved it to a struct and now its encapsulated properly but this presents new challenges

## How to iterate over a stack? Is this even needed?

## How to add autogenerated go documentation?

## Need to add testing with different types
